# highvolnews

This is a *very* simple and *very* naive python script that scrapes a news site and extracts the news that should generate high volatility on markets. (based on the following newsletter bot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UMHhJEaVTQ)

Its end is to minimize time spent visiting websites and as a framework for more individualized personal newsletter.

The way I use it is: put it on a DigitalOcean droplet and run it with iOS Shortcuts with automation.
